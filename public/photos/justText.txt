During my time at Dayforce, I gathered and analyzed extensive data sets to develop detailed and insightful business personas. Leveraging Power BI, I created dynamic visualizations to identify trends and actionable insights. Additionally, I utilized advanced AI tools and methodologies to pinpoint key characteristics, behaviors, and preferences of target personas, enabling the design of more personalized and effective strategies. This approach ensured a comprehensive understanding of customer and employee needs, driving data-informed decision-making across the organization.
